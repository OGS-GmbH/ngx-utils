This repository provides a lightweight collection of utility functions and helpers for Angular applications. Designed to simplify common tasks such as type checking, formatting, data manipulation, and reactive programming patterns, this library helps improve code readability, reusability, and maintainability across projects.

### Configure

The utilities are written in TypeScript and work seamlessly with Angular’s standard tooling. After installation, ensure your project uses a modern TypeScript configuration, then import the functions you need directly from the package. No additional Angular-specific configuration is required.
